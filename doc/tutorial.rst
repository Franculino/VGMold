Tutorial
========

In order to use VGM efficiently it is essential to acquire some basic knowledge
about the underlying programming languages and the packages that provide the
core functionality.
The following tutorials / manuals are recommended:

*  **Python language**
    The `official Python tutorial <http://docs.python.org/tutorial/>`_.

*  **Numpy**
    The numpy package provides a fast array class and a wealth of numerical
    functionality. As a primer, read the `Numpy tutorial
    <http://www.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial>`_ from scipy.org.

*  **Cython**
    Cython provides the possibility to produce *fast* compiled code with the
    clean and simple syntax of Python. Moreover, it eases the pain of interfacing
    with compiled libraries. Consult the `user-guide
    <http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/tutorial.html>`_ and `tutorial
    <http://wiki.cython.org/tutorials>`_

*  **iGraph-Python**
    `Here
    <http://www.cs.rhul.ac.uk/home/tamas/development/igraph/tutorial/tutorial.html>`_
    is an introduction to iGraph-Python.  Since the class VascularGraph is
    derived from iGraph, most of the tutorial also applies to VGM.

*  **Matplotlib**
    Matplotlib provides publication quality 2D plotting (as well as some 3D
    plotting capabilities). `Pyplot
    <http://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html>`_ is the Matlab-like API
    that comes with Matplotlib. Also check out this highly useful `gallery of
    plots <http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html>`_ to pick from and explore.

*  **Sphinx**
    Beautiful, semi-automatic code documentation (this manual is produced using
    Sphinx). Have a look at the `official tutorial
    <http://sphinx-doc.org/tutorial.html>`_ and a very useful 3rd party
    `collection of hints
    <http://scienceoss.com/use-sphinx-for-documentation/>`_. Also, there is a
    primer on `reStructuredText <http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html>`_.

*  **Paraview**
    Paraview 3D plotting is explained in depth `here
    <http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial>`_.  A tutorial on
    Paraview Python-scripting can be found `here
    <http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting>`_.

*  **VisIt**
    Read the `VisIt Manual <https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/manuals.html>`_ and
    the `tutorial on visit python scripting
    <http://www.visitusers.org/index.php?title=VisIt-tutorial-Python-scripting>`_.

*  **VGM**
    The VGM code is documented inline. Explore classes and functions e.g. using
    ipython and introspection. A small, hands-on tutorial is provided in the
    form of SAGE worksheets.
