The VGM package is work in progress. The following items have not yet been
adressed or require more attention:

* Change the inline documentation format to *Sphinx*-Style to produce better
  autodoc output.
* Extend VGM modules, e.g. ``physiology.py`` to account for species
  differences, as more data become available. 
* Perform extensive code profiling and rewrite modules in Cython where
  appropriate.
* Write an *Embedded Pries* solver (core region solved using Pries solver,
  surrounding region solved using Kirchhoff).
