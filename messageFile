linearSystem_htd.py:

the option is added that instead of using the empirical function to compute mu_vivo and the velocity factor
a value can be directly given for both of them


linearSystem_htd_TotFixedDT.py:

- some minor code improvements
- bugfix: at the distribution of RBCs at non capillary divergent bifurcations.


physiology.spyx:

- a diameter limit is introduced fot the function: tube_to_discharge_hematocrit. With too large diameters
  a numerical error will occur otherwise. For diameters larger 1000 micrometers the discharge hematocrit 
  is set equal to the tube hematocrit


vascularGraph.py:

- the assertPoints function so far only adjusted the edge attribute 'points'. Now it also adjusts the order
  of the attributes 'diameters', 'lengths' and if present 'diameters2' and 'lengths2'

- the function: split_edge_relDist has been improved: splitting of edges where one point exactly lies at the
  relDist required is now possible

- the function create_tortuous_structure has been added
